## Features

- **User Input:** Allows the user to input the text they want to convert to speech dynamically.

- **Language Selection:** Provides the option for the user to choose the language for speech synthesis.

- **Auto-generate File Name:** The file name is automatically generated based on the entered text for convenience.

- **Voice Playback:** Integrates audio playback functionality using the `pygame` library.
